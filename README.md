# PreciSplit: A Novel Approach to Predicting Polynomial Regression Data
Welcome to the PreciSplit project repository! This initiative is a pioneering effort led by our team to develop a highly efficient polynomial regression model tailored for Big Data applications. Leveraging a combination of advanced techniques, including Gradient Descent, differential equations, PCA, KNN, Data Segmentation, and linear data prediction models, PreciSplit aims to redefine the landscape of polynomial regression modeling.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

- Efficiency: PreciSplit is designed with a focus on limiting time complexity, resulting in a significant boost in efficiency. Our model outperforms established models like SVR RBF by 43% and SVR Poly by 46% in processing time, even when handling substantial datasets with 25,000 datapoints.

- Generalization: Our methodology goes beyond speed gains. PreciSplit demonstrates considerably improved generalization compared to existing models. This is evident in error results across datasets of varying sizes, as detailed in our research paper.

- Technological Innovation: The project showcases our team's creativity, resilience, and technical prowess. We've addressed challenges related to time complexities and algorithm optimization, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in polynomial regression modeling.
